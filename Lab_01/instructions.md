### Tasks to work on:

- Define a function incr(x,delta) accepting a reference to an integer variable x and an integerr value delta, incrementing x by value. Compare the solution with a C-style function that uses pointers instead of references.
- Define a structure (class) storing information about movies. Each movie is described by its title, production year and rating (from 0 to 10). Create an array of three such objects and fill them with data provided by the user.
- Modify the array to store pointers to objects instead of objects and write code to create and store three movies in the array. Use the new operator to allocate memory and delete to deallocate. Implement a constructor and destructor printing messages to see, when objects are created and destroyed.
- Define a method print() printing the whole information stored in one object. Use it to print the whole array.
- Add a data member “number_of_viewers” to the class.
